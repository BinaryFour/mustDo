# Must Do 📋💪

## About

The MustDo App prioritizes tasks you must complete daily. It will let you schedule recurrent tasks and get them in front of you so you don't have to spend the cycles thinking about what you need to do!

## Tech Stack:

Front end: **React | Next.js**  
Back end: **Django | PostreSQL**

## How to run:

To run the project, you need to spin up the frontend/backend containers.

You can run the docker.sh bash script in the root directory using the "up" and "down" parameters to run both containers in parallel  
You may need to make the script executable first

Here are instructions on how to run the project from the root directory:

1. Run this command to make the script executable:
   `chmod +x docker.sh`

2. Run this command to spin up the app containers:
   `./docker.sh [up|down]`

You can also check the respective README's for instructions on running those containers standalone
